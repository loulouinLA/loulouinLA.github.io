			<p>I live in Venice Beach, California-If you see me on Ocean Front Walk, ask for my photograph, and I'll take one with you for this website!.</p> 

			<p>In April of 2011, when I was six years old, I was living in a rescue home--That's right, I'm a rescue dog--And I'm so grateful to Madeleine Patterson at SoCal Poodle Rescue for helping me when I was really down and out!</p>
